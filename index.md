# Introduction

Featured in this portfolio are multiple lab projects. often times using different virtual machines or physical servers.

## AWS Cloud Computing Project 1

This project is a step by step walkthrough of my AWS Cloud Computing Project. This project shows the reader how to utilize AWS to create an instance running Linux as well as an instance running Windows. The goal is to be able to connect to the Windows instance using another machine on another network utilizing remote desktop.   
>
> Step 1: Create Amazon EC2 instance using a Windows AMI.
> Step 2: Select the instance type and either generate a new pem key pair or use an existing key pair.
> Step 3: Either create a new firewall security group or create one.
> Step 4: Ensure RDP traffic is allowed from anywhere, you can change this if you would like to further restrict who can access this server.
> Step 5: Launch the instance.
> Step 6: 

### Header 3

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l)
  return true;
}
```

```ruby
# Ruby code with syntax highlighting
GitHubPages::Dependencies.gems.each do |gem, version|
  s.add_dependency(gem, "= #{version}")
end
```

#### Header 4

*   This is an unordered list following a header.

###### Header 6

| head1        | head two          | three |
|:-------------|:------------------|:------|
| ok           | good swedish fish | nice  |

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

* * *

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

<dl>
<dt>Name</dt>
<dd>Godzilla</dd>
<dt>Born</dt>
<dd>1952</dd>
<dt>Birthplace</dt>
<dd>Japan</dd>
<dt>Color</dt>
<dd>Green</dd>
</dl>

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
```

```
The final element.
